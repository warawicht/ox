# Tic-Tac-Toe Multiplayer Game Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a Tic-Tac-Toe (OX) game that supports both multiplayer network play and single-player mode against a CPU opponent. The game will be implemented with a client-server architecture to facilitate real-time gameplay between two players over a network.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React for server-side rendering and client-side interactivity
- **Backend**: Node.js with WebSocket for real-time communication
- **Networking**: WebSocket protocol for real-time gameplay
- **Game State Management**: In-memory storage with potential for database persistence

## 3. Game Features

### 3.1 Multiplayer Network Play
- Real-time gameplay between two players over network
- Player authentication and session management
- Matchmaking system
- Game state synchronization

### 3.2 Single Player vs CPU
- Three difficulty levels for CPU opponent (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Local gameplay without network connection
- AI decision-making algorithms

### 3.3 Common Features
- Game board visualization
- Win/loss/draw detection
- Turn management
- Score tracking
- Responsive UI for different screen sizes

## 4. Game Logic

### 4.1 Board Representation
```
 0 | 1 | 2 
-----------
 3 | 4 | 5 
-----------
 6 | 7 | 8 
```

The game board will be represented as an array of 9 positions, numbered 0-8.

### 4.2 Game States
- WAITING_FOR_OPPONENT: Waiting for another player to join
- PLAYER_X_TURN: Player X's turn
- PLAYER_O_TURN: Player O's turn
- PLAYER_X_WON: Player X has won
- PLAYER_O_WON: Player O has won
- DRAW: Game ended in a draw

### 4.3 Win Conditions
A player wins by placing three of their marks in:
- A horizontal row
- A vertical column
- A diagonal line

## 5. Network Architecture

### 5.1 Connection Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant S as Server
    participant C2 as Client 2
    
    C1->>S: Connect
    S->>C1: Connection Acknowledged
    C2->>S: Connect
    S->>S: Match Players
    S->>C1: Game Start (Player X)
    S->>C2: Game Start (Player O)
    C1->>S: Make Move
    S->>C2: Update Board
    C2->>S: Make Move
    S->>C1: Update Board
```

### 5.2 Message Protocol
All communication between clients and server will use JSON messages with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "message_type",
  "payload": {}
}
```

Message Types:
- `JOIN_GAME`: Player requests to join a game
- `GAME_START`: Game has started with assigned player symbols
- `MOVE_MADE`: A player has made a move
- `GAME_UPDATE`: Game state update
- `GAME_OVER`: Game has ended
- `PLAYER_DISCONNECTED`: A player has disconnected

## 6. CPU AI Implementation

### 6.1 Difficulty Levels

#### Easy
- Makes random valid moves
- No strategic consideration

#### Medium
- Blocks opponent's winning moves
- Makes winning moves when available
- Otherwise makes random moves

#### Hard
- Implements minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Optimal play with no possibility of losing
- Always makes the best possible move

### 6.2 AI Decision Process
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI Turn] --> B{Hard Difficulty?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Minimax Algorithm]
    B -->|No| D{Medium Difficulty?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Check Win/Block]
    D -->|No| F[Random Move]
    E -->|Winning Move Available| G[Make Winning Move]
    E -->|Block Needed| H[Block Opponent]
    E -->|Neither| F
    C --> I[Best Move]
    F --> J[Random Valid Position]
    G --> K[Send Move]
    H --> K
    I --> K
    J --> K
```

## 7. Data Models

### 7.1 Game State
```javascript
{
  id: string,              // Unique game identifier
  board: Array(9),         // Current board state
  currentPlayer: 'X'|'O',  // Whose turn it is
  status: string,          // Current game status
  players: {
    X: { id: string, name: string },
    O: { id: string, name: string }
  },
  winner: 'X'|'O'|null,    // Winner of the game
  createdAt: timestamp,    // When the game started
  updatedAt: timestamp     // Last update timestamp
}
```

### 7.2 Player Session
```javascript
{
  id: string,              // Unique player identifier
  name: string,            // Player name
  sessionId: string,       // Session identifier
  connected: boolean,      // Connection status
  wins: number,            // Number of wins
  losses: number,          // Number of losses
  draws: number            // Number of draws
}
```

## 8. API Endpoints

### 8.1 WebSocket Events

#### Client to Server
- `join`: Player joins a game
- `move`: Player makes a move
- `disconnect`: Player disconnects

#### Server to Client
- `gameStart`: Game has started
- `moveMade`: A move has been made
- `gameUpdate`: Game state update
- `gameOver`: Game has ended
- `error`: An error occurred
