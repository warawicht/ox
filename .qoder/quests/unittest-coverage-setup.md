# Unit Test and Code Coverage Setup Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for setting up comprehensive unit testing and code coverage for the Tic-Tac-Toe application. The project is a full-stack Next.js application with both frontend and backend components. The project already has Jest configured with some existing tests, but we need to enhance the setup to include code coverage reporting and ensure comprehensive test coverage across all frontend components, backend API routes, and utilities.

## Current Testing Setup Analysis

The project currently has:
- Jest as the testing framework
- TypeScript support via ts-jest
- Existing tests for game logic (`gameLogic.test.ts`) and AI logic (`aiLogic.test.ts`)
- Testing Library for React component testing
- Basic Jest configuration in `jest.config.js`

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Code Coverage Configuration

We'll configure Jest to generate code coverage reports with the following settings:
- Collect coverage from all source files
- Set coverage thresholds to ensure quality
- Generate HTML and text coverage reports
- Exclude test files and node_modules from coverage

### 2. Additional Test Coverage

We'll add tests for both frontend and backend components:

**Frontend Tests:**
- React components in the `src/components` directory
- Game pages (`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/vs-cpu/page.tsx`, `src/app/multiplayer/page.tsx`)
- Client-side utility functions in `src/utils`

**Backend Tests:**
- API routes in `src/app/api/auth/route.ts` and `src/app/api/game/route.ts`
- WebSocket server functionality in `src/pages/api/websocket.ts`
- Server-side utility functions in `src/utils`

### 3. Test Scripts

We'll add new npm scripts for:
- Running tests with coverage
- Viewing coverage reports
- Enforcing coverage thresholds

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Update Jest Configuration

We'll modify `jest.config.js` to include coverage settings:

```
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  roots: ['<rootDir>/src'],
  testMatch: [
    '**/__tests__/**/*.+(ts|tsx|js)',
    '**/?(*.)+(spec|test).+(ts|tsx|js)'
  ],
  transform: {
    '^.+\.(ts|tsx)$': 'ts-jest'
  },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts'],
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/pages/api/websocket.ts' // Exclude WebSocket server file
  ],
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
  coverageReporters: ['json', 'lcov', 'text', 'clover', 'html'],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    }
  }
};

**Note:** The `collectCoverageFrom` configuration includes all TypeScript and TSX files in the `src` directory, which covers both frontend components and backend API routes. The WebSocket server file is excluded as it's difficult to test in the same environment.

### Testing Architecture

The testing architecture will follow this structure:

```
graph TD
  A[Jest Test Runner] --> B[Frontend Tests]
  A --> C[Backend Tests]
  A --> D[Integration Tests]
  
  B --> B1[Component Tests]
  B --> B2[Page Tests]
  B --> B3[Client Utilities]
  
  C --> C1[API Route Tests]
  C --> C2[WebSocket Tests]
  C --> C3[Server Utilities]
  
  D --> D1[End-to-End Tests]
  D --> D2[Multiplayer Flow]
  D --> D3[API Integration]
  
  A --> E[Coverage Reports]
  E --> E1[HTML Reports]
  E --> E2[JSON Reports]
  E --> E3[Text Summary]
```

### 2. Update package.json Scripts

We'll add new scripts to `package.json`:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "coverage": "jest --coverage && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html"
  }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Component Testing Strategy

For React components in `src/components`, we'll implement tests using:
- React Testing Library
- Mocking of game logic functions where necessary
- Testing of user interactions and state changes

Component tests to implement:
- `GameBoard`: Test cell rendering, click handling, winning combinations
- `GameControls`: Test difficulty selection, new game button
- `GameStatus`: Test status messages for different game states
- `PlayerInfo`: Test player information display and score tracking

### 4. WebSocket Testing

For the WebSocket functionality, we'll:
- Create integration tests using a mock WebSocket server
- Test connection handling, message sending/receiving
- Test error scenarios and connection cleanup
- Test game flow: joining games, making moves, handling wins/draws

### 5. Page Component Testing

For Next.js page components, we'll:
- Test rendering with different game states
- Mock WebSocket connections where applicable
- Test user interactions that trigger game actions

Page tests to implement:
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Test home page rendering, navigation links, player name input
- `src/app/vs-cpu/page.tsx`: Test CPU game flow, difficulty settings, score tracking
- `src/app/multiplayer/page.tsx`: Test multiplayer game flow, connection status, game ID display

### 6. Backend API Testing

For the Next.js API routes, we'll implement tests using:
- Supertest for HTTP request testing
- Mocking of database/storage functions where necessary
- Testing of authentication and authorization logic

API tests to implement:
- `src/app/api/auth/route.ts`: Test user authentication and session management
- `src/app/api/game/route.ts`: Test game creation and retrieval functionality

### 7. Utility Function Testing

Additional tests for utility functions:
- `gameLogic.ts`: Test all helper functions for game state management
- `aiLogic.ts`: Test AI move selection for different difficulty levels

## Coverage Thresholds

We'll set the following minimum coverage thresholds:
- Branches: 80%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%
- Statements: 80%

These thresholds ensure good test coverage while remaining achievable. They can be adjusted based on project requirements.

## Test Report Generation

Jest will generate multiple coverage report formats:
- HTML: For easy browsing of coverage information
- JSON: For integration with other tools
- LCOV: For use with coverage services
- Text: For command-line viewing
- Clover: For integration with CI systems

## CI/CD Integration

The coverage setup will work with CI/CD systems by:
- Generating coverage reports in standard formats
- Failing builds that don't meet coverage thresholds
- Uploading reports to coverage services (e.g., Codecov, Coveralls)

## Test Environment Setup

To run tests locally:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run all tests: `npm test`
3. Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
4. View coverage report: `npm run coverage`

For development:
- Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- View coverage thresholds: Check `jest.config.js`
- View coverage reports: Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

## Backend Testing Considerations

For backend API testing, we'll need to:
- Use Supertest for HTTP request testing
- Mock database/storage operations (in-memory maps in this case)
- Test API endpoints with valid and invalid inputs
- Test authentication and authorization logic
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes are returned

## Frontend Testing Considerations

For frontend component testing, we'll need to:
- Use React Testing Library for DOM testing
- Mock API calls and WebSocket connections
- Test user interactions and state changes
- Test component rendering with different props
- Test accessibility features
- Ensure proper event handling

## Testing Best Practices

We'll follow these best practices:
1. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
2. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests
3. Mock external dependencies to isolate units under test
4. Test edge cases and error conditions
5. Keep tests independent and focused on single behaviors
6. Use setup and teardown functions to reduce code duplication
7. Test both positive and negative scenarios
8. Use realistic test data that represents actual usage
9. Use test data factories for consistent test data
10. Clean up test data after each test

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing this design:
1. All existing functionality will be preserved
2. Code coverage reports will be generated with each test run
3. Test coverage will meet or exceed the defined thresholds
4. Developers will have clear guidance on testing new features
5. CI/CD pipelines will be able to enforce quality standards
6. Component and integration tests will provide confidence in code changes
7. WebSocket functionality will be thoroughly tested
8. All game modes (vs CPU and multiplayer) will have comprehensive test coverage
9. Both frontend and backend components will be thoroughly tested
10. API endpoints will be validated for correct behavior and error handling
